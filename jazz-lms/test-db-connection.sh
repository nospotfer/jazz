echo ""
echo "Option 1: Use Supabase SQL Editor (RECOMMENDED)"
echo "  • Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your Project → SQL Editor"
echo "  • Copy the SQL from: supabase-migration.sql"
echo "  • Paste and run in the SQL Editor"
echo "  • See: SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.md for detailed instructions"
echo ""
echo "Option 2: Enable IPv4/Port Access"
echo "  • Your network might be blocking PostgreSQL ports"
echo "  • Try a different network or VPN"
echo "  • Check firewall settings"
echo ""
echo "Option 3: Use Vercel to Run Migration"
echo "  • Deploy your app to Vercel first"
echo "  • Vercel will be able to connect to Supabase"
echo "  • Use Vercel's environment to run: npx prisma db push"
echo ""
echo "✨ Next Steps:"
echo "  1. Run the SQL migration in Supabase (see SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.md)"
echo "  2. Configure Vercel environment variables (see VERCEL_SETUP.md)"
echo "  3. Deploy to Vercel"
